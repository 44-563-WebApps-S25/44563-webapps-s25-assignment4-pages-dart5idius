    <h2>Comedy of Errors</h2>

    <h3>Act 2, Scene 1: The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.</h3>

    <p class="stage-direction"><strong>Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA</strong></p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,<br>
    That in such haste I sent to seek his master!<br>
    Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA"><strong>LUCIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech">Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,<br>
    And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.<br>
    Good sister, let us dine and never fret:<br>
    A man is master of his liberty:<br>
    Time is their master, and, when they see time,<br>
    They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>Why should their liberty than ours be more?</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA"><strong>LUCIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>Because their business still lies out o' door.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA"><strong>LUCIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>O, know he is the bridle of your will.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>There's none but asses will be bridled so.</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA"><strong>LUCIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.<br>
    There's nothing situate under heaven's eye<br>
    But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:<br>
    The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,<br>
    Are their males' subjects and at their controls:<br>
    Men, more divine, the masters of all these,<br>
    Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,<br>
    Indued with intellectual sense and souls,<br>
    Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,<br>
    Are masters to their females, and their lords:<br>
    Then let your will attend on their accords.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>This servitude makes you to keep unwed.</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA"><strong>LUCIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA"><strong>LUCIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>How if your husband start some other where?</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA"><strong>LUCIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>Till he come home again, I would forbear.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p class="speech"></p>Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;<br>
    They can be meek that have no other cause.<br>
    A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,<br>
    We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;<br>
    But were we burdened with like weight of pain,<br>
    As much or more would we ourselves complain:<br>
    So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,<br>
    With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,<br>
    But, if thou live to see like right bereft,<br>
    This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA"><strong>LUCIANA</strong></h4>
    <p></p>Well, I will marry one day, but to try.<br>
    Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.</p>

    <p class="stage-direction"><strong>Enter DROMIO of Ephesus</strong></p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p></p>Say, is your tardy master now at hand?</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS"><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></h4>
    <p></p>Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears<br>
    can witness.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA"><strong>ADRIANA</strong></h4>
    <p></p>Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS"><strong>DROMIO OF EPHESUS</strong></h4>
    <p></p>Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:<br>
    Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.</p>
