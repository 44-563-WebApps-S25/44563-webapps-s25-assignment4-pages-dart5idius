    <p class="speech">Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h4>
    <p class="speech">Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce understand them.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA">ADRIANA</h4>
    <p class="speech">But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he hath great care to please his wife.</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h4>
    <p class="speech">Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA">ADRIANA</h4>
    <p class="speech">Horn-mad, thou villain!</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h4>
    <p class="speech">I mean not cuckold-mad; But, sure, he is stark mad. When I desired him to come home to dinner, He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold: 'Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he; 'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he: 'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he. 'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?' 'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he: 'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress! I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'</p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA">LUCIANA</h4>
    <p class="speech">Quoth who?</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h4>
    <p class="speech">Quoth my master: 'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.' So that my errand, due unto my tongue, I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders; For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA">ADRIANA</h4>
    <p class="speech">Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h4>
    <p class="speech">Go back again, and be new beaten home? For God's sake, send some other messenger.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA">ADRIANA</h4>
    <p class="speech">Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h4>
    <p class="speech">And he will bless that cross with other beating: Between you I shall have a holy head.</p>

    <h4 class="name ADRIANA">ADRIANA</h4>
    <p class="speech">Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.</p>

    <h4 class="name DROMIO-OF-EPHESUS">DROMIO OF EPHESUS</h4>
    <p class="speech">Am I so round with you as you with me, That like a football you do spurn me thus? You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither: If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.</p>
    <p class="stage-direction"><strong>Exit</strong></p>

    <h4 class="name LUCIANA">LUCIANA</h4>
    <p class="speech">Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!</p>
